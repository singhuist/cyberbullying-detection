      <body>I found the article on this link:  http://glipress.blogspot.com/2008/05/review-13-rule-breaking-fil ms.html  The author is obviously passionate about film, and makes some good points.  Although I think there's too much attention paid to The Empire Strikes Back, which I do not view as a groundbreaking film, sorry.  Time Code is a cheap gimmick movie, and very hard to watch for more than 10 minutes.  Requiem for a Dream is not the first anti-drug movie.  And, as groundbreaking films go, where was Citizen Kane?  I would have also mentioned Metropolis, M, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, Anatomy of a Murder, Blade Runner, Rope, and several silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari &amp; The Passion of Joan of Arc if I was talking about films with a notable influence years after they were made.</body>

      <body>Okay...cool article...But I'm quite sure the good guys lost before The Empire Strikes Back... Where was Last Tango in Paris...X-rated feature film, not a porn is quite ground-breaking...that they went with it without cutting it to suit the ratings people...  Goodfellas?...hmmm...I don't think so.... I would go more into this...but I'm strapped for time right now</body>

      <body> Yes, Citizen Kane and those other films were ground-breaking, but they didn't "break the rules" of what conventional film-making wisdom seems to dictate audiences will put up with.</body>

      <body>meh. Only one comment.  Russian ark is flat out boring... And Hitchcock did the one continuous shot thing in  Rope (1948). Difference being that Hitch didn't have a digital camera.</body>

      <body>None of these films actually broke any rules... Cannibal Holocaust actually broke rules... the director was arrested for animal cruelty, and the dead people had to be shown in court so as to prove they weren't really killed...</body>

      <body>I agree with Mike M, citizen Kane shouldve been on there. Theres a reason why film schools all over emphasize this film so much.  I prob will catch some heat for saying this but maybe reservior dogs should've shown the heist. that movie was pretty boring to me the way it was told. I kind of came in expecting a lot more than what I got.</body>

      <body> No one's disputing that Citizen Kane was a watershed in cinema, but what qualifies it to be on a list of "rule-breakers"?</body>
