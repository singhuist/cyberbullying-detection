      <body> Some people don't watch TV or listen to the radio. not because they are lazy but because the political system in this country is flawed. Dems try to make it about hope and future (even though they can't really bring about a better future) and the Republican try and win by using fear (a vote for Obama is a vote for a terrorist) as the videos you have posted proves (so thanks for proving my point for me Desperate Republicans).</body>

      <body>  Last-minute research and listening to pundits does not quite equal the same as actually following the campaigns. And a lot of people have died for a lot of rights we don't invoke at every opportunity.  Also it really did sneak up on me.</body>

      <body> I'll agree with you on the last min thing. What did Desperate Republicans say about meat intake. I think he is loosing it. We already know he is in denial about who is going to win the election.</body>
