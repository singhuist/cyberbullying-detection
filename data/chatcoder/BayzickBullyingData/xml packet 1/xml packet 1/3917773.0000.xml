      <body> White House: North Korea Assisted Syria On Nuclear Reactor Destroyed By Israel   White House: Syria Must 'Come Clean' About Nukes (2:27 min.)  Web Extra: U.S. Intel Video Cites N.K., Syria Link (11:50 min.)  Bush Administration Opens Up About Israeli Airstrike On Syrian Reactor WASHINGTON (CBS News) Ã¢&#128;&#149; The White House said Thursday that North Korea's secret work on anuclear reactor with Syria was "a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the world," raising doubts aboutPyongyang's intention to carry through with a promised disclosure ofits nuclear activities.  Sevenmonths after Israel bombed the reactor, the White House broke itssilence and said North Korea assisted Syria's secret nuclear programand that the destroyed facility was not intended for "peacefulpurposes."  The disclosure could undermine six-party negotiationsto try to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea. The WhiteHouse issued a two-page statement after lawmakers were given detailsabout the reactor in a series of briefings on Capitol Hill. The WhiteHouse said the International Atomic Energy Agency also was beingbriefed on the intelligence.  While calling North Korea's nuclearassistance to Syria a "dangerous manifestation" of Pyongyang's nuclearweapons program and its proliferation activities, the U.S. said itremained committed to the talks.  The administration said that after the reactor was damaged beyond repair, Syria tried to bury evidence of its existence.  "Thiscover-up only served to reinforce our confidence that this reactor wasnot intended for peaceful activities," White House press secretary DanaPerino said. "The Syrian regime must come clean before the worldregarding its illicit nuclear activities."  CIA Director MichaelHayden, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and NationalSecurity Adviser Stephen Hadley briefed lawmakers, who were shown avideo presentation of intelligence information that the administrationcontends establishes a strong link between North Korea's nuclearprogram and the bombed Syrian site. It included still photographs thatshowed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant andthe one near Yongbyon.  According to officials familiar with thepresentation, it did not show moving images inside the facility or anyNorth Korean workers, but included photographs that depict similaritiesbetween the North Korean and Syrian reactor designs.  U.S.negotiators have been trying hard to close a deal in which North Koreawould admit to and give up all its nuclear activities in return forbeing taken off the list of countries that support terrorism, reportsCBS News national security correspondent David Martin.  But atthe same time, the administration had all the photos showing NorthKorea was secretly helping Syria build a reactor that could produceplutonium for nuclear weapons, adds Martin. The images include a photothat U.S. intelligence says shows the head of Syria's nuclear agencywith one of the North Koreans who was negotiating with the UnitedStates.  By making the photos public, Martin reports, the U.S. istelling North Korea: "If you won't come clean, we'll come clean foryou."  The Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by Israeli jets waswithin weeks or months of being functional, a top U.S. official toldThe Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of thesensitivity of the matter. The official said the facility was mostlycompleted but still needed significant testing before it could bedeclared operational.  No uranium, which is needed to fuel areactor, was evident at the site, a remote area of eastern Syria alongthe Euphrates River. But the U.S. official said the reactor was similarin design to a North Korean reactor at Yongbyon, which has in the pastproduced small amounts of plutonium, the marterial needed to makepowerful nuclear weapons.  Top members of the House IntelligenceCommittee said the reactor posed a serious threat of spreadingdangerous nuclear materials.  "This is a serious proliferationissue, both for the Middle East and the countries that may be involvedin Asia," said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.  Hoekstra andIntelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the Bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  "It'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public," Hoekstra said.  President Bush'sfailure to keep Congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for Bush's policies toward North Korea and Syria,he said.  "It totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and Congress," Hoekstra said. "I think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with" regardingNorth Korea.  A senior administration said the White House wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe Middle East region, reports CBS News White House correspondent MarkKnoller.  "We feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly Syria might feel greater pressure to react," the official said.  The White House also stressed that North Korea's assistance on the Syrian reactor was an issue of "great international concern."  "Theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world," Perino said inthe statement. "This is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  "The United Statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region."</body>

      <body>Why come clean,, Iraq came clean with inspectors and they submitted every bit of evidence with a 1000 pages that it was not in pocession of WMDs, yet it was meaningless in the goal to invade the sovereign nation anyway. This come clean nonsense is all political rhedoric to appease stupid people who support policies of an aggressive preemtive nature and dont want the truth.</body>

      <body> Pete:  I have had discussions with one of the iraqi inspectors - who is fluent in Arabic. He is fluent enough that he gets paid to do translations. He is also a friend of a close friend.  He said that Iraq DID have WMD's, that they hid information, that they had spies int he inspection teams, that they knew when the inspectors were coming. Inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  The truth in Syria is that North Korea was working with Syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the U.S. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. That agreement was worked out by one Jimmy Carter under the auspices of the Clinton administration. The North Koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning.</body>
