      <body>Probably not. It has the best reviews from Princeton Review. It's an all honors college with only about 700 kids.</body>

      <body>i don't go there but i live in sarasota and it is practically down the street, a lot of kids from my school went there. it is a very good school and very very liberal. and the grading system is completly different. good choice if you ask me.</body>

      <body>It seems like I get the same sort of response from people who went there saying they loved it and it was completely different than any other school.  I'll have to look into this other grading scale system tomorrow when I talk to them.</body>
