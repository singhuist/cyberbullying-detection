      <body>my best friend goes to UT austin. i visit her a lot up there. she has some likes and dislikes about it. however, it all depends on what u want to study. some schools have better programs in different things than other schools...like u of houston (go coogs!) we have a really good psychology program and music program...and business...texas southern (right across from us) has a really good pharmacy program.</body>

      <body>UT is an awesome school. I miss the long walks to class &amp; the bus rides. (I really do! haha) I had a great time while I was in Austin... coffee shops, live shows, football, &amp; Leslie! I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've liked towards the end (b/c of work/studying), but I would definitely recommend it. I hope to move back to Austin in a couple years. Can't wait!</body>
