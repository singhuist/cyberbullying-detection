      <body>This may sound terrible, but with the success of the 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad, I would LOVE to see a Freaks &amp; Geeks movie. Pick up with the Weir family reunion. The cast would be AMAZING: Directed and produced by Paul Feig and Judd Apatow (original creators)  Seth Rogan Linda Cardellini James Franco Jason Segel John Frances Daley Martin Starr Joe Flaherty Samm Levine Busy Philipps  Since it only go one season, we could find out what happened to Lindsey after she gets on the bus, see what the Freaks have done with their lives, etc. I would love to see that happen.</body>
