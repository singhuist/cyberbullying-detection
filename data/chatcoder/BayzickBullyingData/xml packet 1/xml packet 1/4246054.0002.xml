      <body> Ok thats a good reason not to vote. But it's not a smart thing to do. People have fought and died to allow you this right. you should be proud to do your own research and vote for the person you believe in.</body>

      <body>Because my candidate dropped out. And I don't think that either mainstream candidate has the best interests of the country and it's citizens in their real plan. I also think the founding fathers would want another revoloution by now.</body>

      <body> Some people don't watch TV or listen to the radio. not because they are lazy but because the political system in this country is flawed. Dems try to make it about hope and future (even though they can't really bring about a better future) and the Republican try and win by using fear (a vote for Obama is a vote for a terrorist) as the videos you have posted proves (so thanks for proving my point for me Desperate Republicans).</body>

      <body>  Last-minute research and listening to pundits does not quite equal the same as actually following the campaigns. And a lot of people have died for a lot of rights we don't invoke at every opportunity.  Also it really did sneak up on me.</body>
