      <body>I found the article on this link:  http://glipress.blogspot.com/2008/05/review-13-rule-breaking-fil ms.html  The author is obviously passionate about film, and makes some good points.  Although I think there's too much attention paid to The Empire Strikes Back, which I do not view as a groundbreaking film, sorry.  Time Code is a cheap gimmick movie, and very hard to watch for more than 10 minutes.  Requiem for a Dream is not the first anti-drug movie.  And, as groundbreaking films go, where was Citizen Kane?  I would have also mentioned Metropolis, M, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, Anatomy of a Murder, Blade Runner, Rope, and several silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari &amp; The Passion of Joan of Arc if I was talking about films with a notable influence years after they were made.</body>

      <body>Okay...cool article...But I'm quite sure the good guys lost before The Empire Strikes Back... Where was Last Tango in Paris...X-rated feature film, not a porn is quite ground-breaking...that they went with it without cutting it to suit the ratings people...  Goodfellas?...hmmm...I don't think so.... I would go more into this...but I'm strapped for time right now</body>

      <body> Yes, Citizen Kane and those other films were ground-breaking, but they didn't "break the rules" of what conventional film-making wisdom seems to dictate audiences will put up with.</body>
