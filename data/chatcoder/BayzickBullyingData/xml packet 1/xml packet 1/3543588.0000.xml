      <body>More and more companies are moving to cheaper countries like Slovenia, Poland, China, India, because the manpower is cheaper there. At the beginning it was low qualified jobs, it was not looking so "dangerous". But now, it is skilled jobs too.  Soon, we wont have any jobs left in the rich countries : the work will be done in eastern Europe or in Asia . Sounds very bad.</body>

      <body>You know I hear a similiar complaint here in Asia EXCEPT they are complaining about losing management and other high paid positions to Americans and Europeans.  In all honesty, it's still in our benefit.  They do the labor, we make the profit.  All this means is our economies will turn more and more service related.  This could have long term military reprecusions but economically this is actually beneficial for us.  Think of it this way.  We pay some one in Taiwan 50 cents to make a pair of Nike's.  We slap our name brand on it and sell it at stores in China for $80.  Now, who is really making out there?   I have thought about the long term result of this and I can see an actual socialist economy that would function properly from this where the corporate wealth is taxed and distributed amongst our populace, all being leveraged up by foreign labor.</body>

      <body>What's our unemployment rate?  What's our real GNI Per capita?  What's our real median income per capita?  So WTF DO YOU MEAN IT'S GOING DOWN THE TUBE?  WE ARE FUCKING RICH!  Stop whinning you spoiled fucking ignorant american trash!  I have a driver.  He is married and has a daughter.  I pay him $70 a month.  That is up from the $35 we started him out on.  I like him so I gave him a raise.  We have 2 maids.  We are paying them $35 a month.  Norway and Luxembourg are the ONLY two countries in the entire fucking world with a higher per capita income.  REAL income, only luxembourg.  The gap between America and the developed countries has steadily increased over the last 20 years as the other developed countries were stupid enough to cave in to socialist pressures more than we were.  We hit a recession in 2001.  It lasted a whole fucking 2 months before we borrowed our way out of it (god I love war economies).  During that time our real income per capita declined.  It took 2 more years for things to shift back towards growth.  The last 3 years we had very strong economic growth.  Even right now with all the scare of a recession we are sporting a 3% real annual GDP growth, higher than the EU, Japan, Canada, and Australia.  So I will summarize again.  We are the richest country in the world in total and per capita (luxembourg is like 400k people or some shit like that, it doesn't really count imo) and we are getting richer.  For the last 3 years our real GDP growth has matched the world growth.  If you know anything about economic convergence you would understand why this is incredible in itself.  We are rich and getting richer and you stupid spoiled fucks want to bitch.</body>

      <body>Where is the profit when the americans see their jobs going abroad ? The benefits go to the companies, not to the american people.  The usa are very rich, but the unemployment rate is higher because jobs are going abroad.  Average salary in the US may be high, but the life is expensive there too. And the riches are not distributed equally between the people : you got one guy earning 10,000 dollars a month and next to him a guy with nothing. In average it is 5,000 , but in reality that sucks !  (ps nobody care about your private life and if you hire slaves to clean your house.)</body>

      <body>That's Capitalisam for you. It is based on the fact that somebody must be riped-off so that other may have more. It has nothing to do with justice, morality, national pride or loyalty. Capitalisam is an individual fight where everything goes.</body>

      <body>Apparently you did not read what I said.  MEDIAN INCOME PER CAPITA.  We have the third highest real median per capita.  America is cheaper than the UK, France, Germany, Norway, Australia, Japan, ect and we earn a higher income than all of those places (except norway but it's higher after you adjust for cost of living).  The disparity between the rich and poor in America is increasing, although it is still lower than most developed nations, but not because the poor are getting poor but simply because the growth of the middle class is lower than the growth of the upper class.  This should not be surprising.  WTF are you talking about our unemployment rate?  We are around 5% unemployment.  That's not "bad".  That's historically quite a bit below average.  The only developed nation that is having better employment than us is Australia (I don't count Japan because it's actually hindering their economy) and that's because they have such a small population but a relatively large land base.</body>

      <body>Isn't the US unemployment rate a false statistic?  As far as i know It only shows the people claiming benefits, not the total people who are out of work.  Im no economist Indonesia, but the middle class growth your talking about, surely if the pattern continues that most jobs are outsourced to other nations then wouldn't the middle class will begin to stifle? That $80 dollar nike shoe thats sold in China is also sold in the US. People need well paid jobs to have disposable income. The more disposable income the more sales of branded products are possible. If industrial jobs keep going abroad for cheaper labour, then the less cash people have at home to keep the whole thing ticking over. How are people supposed to buy $80 shoes, when jobs keep going abroad?</body>
