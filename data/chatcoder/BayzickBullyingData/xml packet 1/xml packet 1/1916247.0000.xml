      <body>Well they also made the movie bad was they made it pg for the little kids who dont know what was going on at all. They should have made it pg 13. Cuase the battle is way more intense. They torch the urgal to the piont where their skin is melting off. And there's like a foot deep of blood at the end to the battle too. In the movie theres 50 dead people and NO blood.</body>

      <body>Well, I didn't get any "Star Wars" feeling, but I thought it was a good movie anyway. I haven't read the book though.</body>

      <body>I never read the book, probably never will. The movie was so corny that at first I thought about walking out, but then I just started laughing at how corny and gay it was. I actually enjoyed mocking the movie, it was that stupid.</body>
