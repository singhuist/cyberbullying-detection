      <body>  Last-minute research and listening to pundits does not quite equal the same as actually following the campaigns. And a lot of people have died for a lot of rights we don't invoke at every opportunity.  Also it really did sneak up on me.</body>

      <body> I'll agree with you on the last min thing. What did Desperate Republicans say about meat intake. I think he is loosing it. We already know he is in denial about who is going to win the election.</body>

      <body> I can't have a civil conversation when you are trying to make American a country of hate and bigotry. I can't believe that someone like you who is obviously smart enough to type isn't smart enough to see that what they are doing is bad for America. If you don't like Obama or one of the other candidates. They say why you think John is better. Don't post Racist Videos about Obama. Americans are smarter than that.</body>
