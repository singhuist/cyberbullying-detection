    of them are just plain silly.<br>the purpose of this blog group is to 
    reveal the lies and dismiss the propaganda as utter nonsense!<br>read on, 
    enlighten yourself and tell someone about how they have been lied to all 
    of these years. and above all else, smoke out a friend today!<br>click the

    kind of having second thoughts about meeeting you simply because i'm 
    paranoid about this being a set-up. ever hear of a website called 
    http://www.perverted-justice.com/ go check it out and you'll see why i'm 
    paranoid. nevertheless, i believe that you are for real.<br>the library

    /24/06<br>marijuana : that link i sent you is not porn. perverted justice 
    is a website that has people posing as underage girls in chatrooms then 
    when the &quot;underage girl&quot; and and older person decide to meet they arrest 
    that person.<br>here's and excerpt from their website. it tells of their 
    goal.<br>our goal is rather simple and specific, actually. a lot of people 
    will say &quot;hello, you guys aren't ending pedophilia.&quot; well no, we don't 
    &quot;end pedophilia as we know it.&quot; that's not our goal. the goal of this 
    website and our endeavors is to create a &quot;chilling effect&quot; in regional 
    chat rooms and other easy targets of opportunity online such as social 
    networking websites. simply stated, we want to poison the well of these 
    rooms and places by covering enough of them that even if you're looking 
    for underage females, and extra bit of paranoia will cross your mind.<br>we 
    believe that regional chat rooms and social networking sites are the most 
    ready and easy way for and individual to try to &quot;hook up with&quot; underage 
    females. many parents don't understand the harms and dangers their child 
    faces by going into those rooms. basically, you're letting complete 
    strangers into your childs bedroom or frontroom. and since it's 
    &quot;regional,&quot; these people don't live that far away. a kid goes into this 
    cesspool, they're basically at the mercy of chance. our goal is to help 
    reduce that chance by covering these rooms to a point where we have and 
    impact and create and atmosphere where such happenings become rarer and 
    rarer.<br>additionally , we have the goal of turning the website into a 
    conviction machine with as many information first agreements with police 
    as possible. as of this writing, our information first agreements cover 
    over 2/3rds of the united states. these agreements have been invaluable in 
    our endeavors to toss as many people in jail as possible.<br>and this is 
    from their front page...there was a big bust in riverside!!<br>just 
    because the main page hasn't been updated doesn't mean we're slacking. 
    laguna beach police contacted us in january after the riverside sting of 
    51 internet predators over three days became public wanting to do the same 
    thing right next door in laguna beach, california. saturday, february 
    18th, they set up a place in laguna and gave us eleven hours to see what 
    we could do... the resultquestion 13 men solicting our profiles for sex. 
    working the same area that we worked for riverside... only two weeks after 
    dateline 3 aired... they're still out there looking for kids.<br>this 
    sting saw men from all walks of life arrive to be arrested, from a 
    starbucks employee all the way up to a lieutenant in the california 
    highway patrol. read the orange county da's press release here where more 
    details are given by o.c. da tony rackauckas. 13 men in one night is the 
    fourth time in a little over a month where we have set a new national 
    standard for the amount of predators arrested in one night in one county. 
    before riverside, the record was five... a record we have more than 
    doubled each night in the four nights we have worked large-scale stings 
    with law enforcement in california.<br>if you are a law enforcement 
    professional and would like to know more about our operation, please read 
    this link. a very special and public thanks to both the orange county da 
    and the laguna beach police we worked with to make this happen, they were 
    one of the first departments to contact us in the wake of riverside and 
    were a pleasure to work with.<br>see why i'm paranoid!!questionquestion<br><br>-

    haven't forgotten about you, it's just that i'm unsure of risking anything

    then there's still the risk of me getting caught for kidnapping you of 
    some crazy shit like that.<br>i know what you're saying...&quot;but you 
    wouldn't be kidnapping me, i'd be going with you on my own free will.&quot;

    sunday but it is monday i can ask to get dropped off<br><br><br>7 /28/06<br><br>christopher 
    : a new better idea<br>hey ! i just remembered.<br>well , hold on...let me 
    give you the good news first! i sold the ipod today for a cool $100 so 
    that gives me ample money to buy my bus ticket, which i will do tomorrow. 
    unfortunately, i have to go all the way to san jose...about 30 miles from 
    where i am .<br>i still have yet to sell my bike though and i can't just 
    leave it behind or bring it with either. i want to sell it. so what i was 
    thinking is this...if i bought a bus ticket tomorrow for a week in 
    advance, leaving next sunday, it would save me $20. the tickets are 
    cheaper when purchased a week in advance.<br>i have a question for you. do 
    you think the mall is closer to the greyhound station or is the norco 
    libraryquestion i've already checked and the library is about 17 miles 
    from the greyhound. could you give me and address for the nearest 
    mallquestion could you get your mom to drop you off there the following 
    mondayquestion it would actually be better because there are more people 
    which means unless chance of anyone seeing us leaving together.<br>soooo 
    ....i got some cash so i'll go buy a phone card and call you sometime 
    tomorrow. does that sound coolquestion try to get the phone from your mom 
    tomorrow.<br><br>ok , sweetie....*big hug and a kiss from daddy*<br><br><br>7 
    /29/06<br><br>christopher : good! you got this message! i didn't know if 
    you did or not because myspace was acting cracked yesterday afternoon. i 
    sent the same message to your yahoo email, just in case. how often do you 
    check that anywayzquestion<br>so what's the address of the mallquestion i 
    need to know. if it's closer from the greyhound station, we can meet 
    there. or just give me the name of the mall. i can look it up online.<br>sorry 
    about selling the ipod. didn't know you wanted one. i'll give you a big 
    hug, kiss and a squeeze to make up for it when i see you!!<br>i have a 
    potential buyer for my inoperative cellphone today. that should bring me 
    another $95. goddamn it! noone wants my bike!! i can't just leave her 
    behind. if i sell the phone, i may just give my bike to someone, provided 
    that i deem them worthy of taking care of her.<br>i'll give you a call 
    today. not sure what time. just be ready.<br><br>love , daddy...<br><br><br>-
