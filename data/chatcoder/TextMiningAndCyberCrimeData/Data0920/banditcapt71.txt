banditcapt71 [4:23 P.M.]: I was hoping that my five minute ride was going to be just 5 minutes, I was extremely wrong
banditcapt71 [4:23 P.M.]: I forgot what kind of bike I had
banditcapt71 [4:24 P.M.]: everybody and their mothers wanted me to stop so they could have a look at it
Torpedo Dorito [4:24 P.M.]: what kind is it
banditcapt71 [4:24 P.M.]: its a mountain bike that I customized myself 
banditcapt71 [4:25 P.M.]: i have the kind of bike that gets printed in magazines
Torpedo Dorito [4:25 P.M.]: like ur boat
banditcapt71 [4:25 P.M.]: its pretty far out
banditcapt71 [4:25 P.M.]: yeah very much like my boat
banditcapt71 [4:25 P.M.]: both my boat and my bike stand out
Torpedo Dorito [4:26 P.M.]: i dont stand out
banditcapt71 [4:26 P.M.]: to me you do, because I just like looking at you
Torpedo Dorito [4:27 P.M.]: what if when we have sex you dont like me
banditcapt71 [4:28 P.M.]: Luke to be perfectly honest, i strongly think there wont be anytime at all where i wont like you
banditcapt71 [4:28 P.M.]: i like you all the time
banditcapt71 [4:29 P.M.]: not some of the time and im not interested in you for your body or for sex, dont get me wrong its all very good but i see you as more than that
banditcapt71 [4:29 P.M.]: you're a beautiful Person luke
Torpedo Dorito [4:30 P.M.]: but being a boyfriend the sex is the best part
banditcapt71 [4:30 P.M.]: i like to think the passion towards one another is, but sex ranks up there too
banditcapt71 [4:32 P.M.]: allow me to give you an Idea, as to where im coming from with that, when you called me up Luke, and i got to hear your voice its like time stood still for me because i really love what I heard, i think you have a beautiful voice
Torpedo Dorito [4:32 P.M.]: ok
banditcapt71 [4:33 P.M.]: so from the last time we talked, I asked you a question that I dont think i got the answer to
Torpedo Dorito [4:33 P.M.]: i want to be your boyfriend really but i am scared kinda
banditcapt71 [4:34 P.M.]: what is it that you're afraid of?
Torpedo Dorito [4:34 P.M.]: im afraid you might find another guy you like more
banditcapt71 [4:35 P.M.]: that will never ever happen, and I'll gladly tell you why that wont ever happen
banditcapt71 [4:36 P.M.]: I have had the same thing happen to me 2 times back to back with each other and it hurt me really bad, and from talking to you by IM email and by phone I know that I like you enough to stay with you for the long run
Torpedo Dorito [4:36 P.M.]: why did the other ones leave you
banditcapt71 [4:36 P.M.]: the wanted someone younger
banditcapt71 [4:37 P.M.]: and they ended up finding that someone
banditcapt71 [4:37 P.M.]: so i got put on my ass
banditcapt71 [4:37 P.M.]: despite all the love affection, and the gifts that I gave it didnt matter
Torpedo Dorito [4:38 P.M.]: were they my age
banditcapt71 [4:38 P.M.]: one was 13, and the other one was 16
Torpedo Dorito [4:38 P.M.]: will that happen to me
banditcapt71 [4:39 P.M.]: I only broke up with someone only one time in my entire life and it was because I was more interested in Guys
banditcapt71 [4:39 P.M.]: so the idea of me breaking up with you is extremely unlikely
banditcapt71 [4:41 P.M.]: I really want to be your man and Im not afraid to stick by you forever
Torpedo Dorito [4:42 P.M.]: can i stay over nite?
banditcapt71 [4:42 P.M.]: you can stay many nights if you wanted
Torpedo Dorito [4:43 P.M.]: just gonna be hard to tell my mom where im going
banditcapt71 [4:43 P.M.]: if push comes to shove I'll come to you and get a hotelroom close to where you live so you can just walk right on over
banditcapt71 [4:45 P.M.]: and if you can arrange something to come out to Long Island I'll gladly accept your saty with me, and I'll do the best I possibly can to make you feel comfortable
Torpedo Dorito [4:45 P.M.]: i wish i could just run away
banditcapt71 [4:46 P.M.]: where would you want to go?
Torpedo Dorito [4:46 P.M.]: to your house
banditcapt71 [4:46 P.M.]: my door will always be open to you
Torpedo Dorito [4:47 P.M.]: my mom would come find me i'm sure
banditcapt71 [4:47 P.M.]: my place is next to impossible to find
Torpedo Dorito [4:47 P.M.]: what about my school i have to go to school
banditcapt71 [4:48 P.M.]: well I would want you to do what you felt to be the most comfortable
banditcapt71 [4:48 P.M.]: for you
Torpedo Dorito [4:48 P.M.]: this is hard
banditcapt71 [4:49 P.M.]: well I will side with you no matter what you decide on and I will do my best to help you do whats right for you
banditcapt71 [4:50 P.M.]: hey Luke could you call my phone again I'd love the chance to hear your voice once again
Torpedo Dorito [4:51 P.M.]: i can later when my mom is gone
banditcapt71 [4:51 P.M.]: oh ok
banditcapt71 [4:51 P.M.]: Luke I want to word this question the same way I did when i first asked it the other day ok?
Torpedo Dorito [4:51 P.M.]: ok
banditcapt71 [4:54 P.M.]: Luke since the day I first saw you I fell in love my feelings for you have grown deeper over that past few days in the face of the powerful sting of multiple break ups from former lovers that will be no more, as a final stant to be inlove and to share passion with another man, I ask of you to be my only form of happiness in the form of my beautiful boyfriend, I will promise you that you will be the only one I see, and nothing will ever come between you and me
Torpedo Dorito [4:56 P.M.]: i really want to but what if we are boyfriends how can we always be with eachother because of my mom
banditcapt71 [4:56 P.M.]: I have my ways
Torpedo Dorito [4:57 P.M.]: then i get all sad if i cannt see you all the time
banditcapt71 [4:57 P.M.]: again you would be worth it for me to make it a point to see you as often as you needed me to
Torpedo Dorito [4:57 P.M.]: but i want all the time
banditcapt71 [4:58 P.M.]: one of my ex boyfriends lived in North Dakota I managed to go see him, you only live in queens
banditcapt71 [4:59 P.M.]: if you want all the time I'll give you all the time, there's nothing i wouldnt do for my baby
Torpedo Dorito [4:59 P.M.]: ok but i dont have any friends so my mom is going to think something wrong if im always gone
banditcapt71 [5:00 P.M.]: well when you're in a relationship with me, you'll learn that I've done thought of some pretty amazing escape plans for over controlling parents
Torpedo Dorito [5:01 P.M.]: what do you mean?
banditcapt71 [5:01 P.M.]: let me give you an example
banditcapt71 [5:02 P.M.]: my ex who lives in North Dakota, I managed to give him a plan to get his strict dad to allow him to spend the night with me
banditcapt71 [5:03 P.M.]: I did this but telling him to tell his dad that he made a new friend that asked him to sleep over and i acted like that so called friend's dad and spoke to his dad for him to cover for him, it worked like a charm
Torpedo Dorito [5:03 P.M.]: that might work
banditcapt71 [5:04 P.M.]: its flawless your mom isnt in your school and cant possibly know who you talk to or dont talk to
Torpedo Dorito [5:04 P.M.]: i just never have any friends over here i really dont have any
banditcapt71 [5:05 P.M.]: please be mine and I will show you a life that can only make you happy on a regular basis
Torpedo Dorito [5:05 P.M.]: will sex hurt?
banditcapt71 [5:06 P.M.]: it would if I do it wrong, but i will do everything in my power to keep it from hurting you in anyway
Torpedo Dorito [5:06 P.M.]: what's wrong?
banditcapt71 [5:06 P.M.]: if i dont use any lube when i go to enter you or if i put it in you too fast
banditcapt71 [5:06 P.M.]: that would be wrong
Torpedo Dorito [5:07 P.M.]: can i do that to you?
banditcapt71 [5:07 P.M.]: you can do anything if you're my boyfriend
Torpedo Dorito [5:07 P.M.]: really?
