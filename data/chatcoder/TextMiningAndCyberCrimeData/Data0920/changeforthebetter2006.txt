coryndestiny4ever (05:46:51 PM): kewl
changeforthebetter2006 (05:47:13 PM): just looking for some fun (How relevant is this if he's not looking for it from me?)
changeforthebetter2006 (05:47:18 PM): a hook up

coryndestiny4ever (03:43:56 PM): so?
changeforthebetter2006 (03:44:02 PM): I went to court Friday about it (Court? Tell me more!)
coryndestiny4ever (03:44:12 PM): wat u do?
changeforthebetter2006 (03:44:19 PM): My attorney and I plea bargained
changeforthebetter2006 (03:44:51 PM): This next Thurday, I go to jail for it for it for 11 months (Jail for the next eleven months? So he's trying to get one last hookup before he goes into jail. 'Cept that hookup is with a kid. Right. Got it.)
coryndestiny4ever (03:45:00 PM): omg really wat did u do??? (Okay I tried as hard as I could to act natural kid-like here. It was hard. I was DYING wanting to know.)
changeforthebetter2006 (03:45:20 PM): I got busted sliciting (Soliciting? Like a prostitute? Let's find out.)
coryndestiny4ever (03:45:34 PM): wat tat mean?
changeforthebetter2006 (03:46:00 PM): remember I told you the story about my friend that got busted? (Friend. Busted. Check.)
coryndestiny4ever (03:46:03 PM): ya
changeforthebetter2006 (03:46:10 PM): I did too (He got busted soliciting a child online. He pled guilty. And... came back online to do it again that same weekend. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a serious predator on our hands.)
coryndestiny4ever (03:46:13 PM): omg (I was quite serious about this one)
changeforthebetter2006 (03:46:26 PM): that is why I was soooo hesitant to believe you (He probably should have gone with that gut instinct or perhaps just stayed away from the internet so that he wasn't tempted.)
coryndestiny4ever (03:46:33 PM): omg im 4 real (Okay so I lied while he was busy coming clean. I'll take my one way ticket to hell now.)
changeforthebetter2006 (03:46:55 PM): I had to know without a doubt that I wasnt stepping into it again (So he knew that what he was doing had the potential to get him arrested again, but doesn't think about it in terms of "Oh this is wrong." He thinks about it in terms of "I just gotta know I'm not going to get caught." This makes me sick.) 
coryndestiny4ever (03:47:10 PM): :(
coryndestiny4ever (03:47:26 PM): i dont think ur bad
changeforthebetter2006 (03:47:40 PM): thats why I kept asking you to say things because the cops are not allowed to ask, only agree with what the other person says (He thinks he's a legal expert, you know having been busted for it before. Except for one thing. I'm not a cop.)
coryndestiny4ever (03:47:55 PM): o ic i get it
changeforthebetter2006 (03:48:15 PM): and then when you asked what color of car I had, the cop that busted me asked me the same exact question (We were NOT going to get a car description out of him. No way. No how.)
