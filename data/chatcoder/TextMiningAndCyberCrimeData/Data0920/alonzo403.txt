alonzo403 (3/24/2006 4:18:54 PM): good taste (He doesn't even know it's not alcohol. Time to exercise more and booze less, budro)

alonzo403 (3/24/2006 4:31:56 PM): if u dont call i know u r a wimp (Utterly shameless attempt to "challenge" me to call, as if that will make a 15 year old want him more)

alonzo403 (3/24/2006 4:32:24 PM): ill wait


Hear Alonzo on the phone with our great verifier, Van De
(right click to download, hit "save as")


He doesn't get explicit on the phone, he's still being cautious with his patented "I'm too smart for the cops, I'll be vague" garbage. Still, what a creepy voice.
